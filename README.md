# NovaBorn2 INDEV
 A little test for the mechanics of Novaborn 2. 
Features a reworked PlayerController that uses mouse to look around, meaning you can strafe now, and shoot upwards, and a simplified control scheme.
Features materials giving the Novaborn the feel it was always meant to have.
Features multiplayer Via PUN/Photon.

Currently a battle royale, it will be a Co-op PVE in the future, hopefully with multiple missions with detail, so it might be a short campaign.

Right Click activates a super jump.

Left Click to shoot.

WASD to move
